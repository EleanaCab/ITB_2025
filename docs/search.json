    "text": "The course will exclusively use R in the integrated development environment (IDE) called R Studio. Since the summer semester is only 1 month (10 classes), it is critical to have your computer set up and ready to go before the first day of class.\nThroughout the course, there will be a set of pre-lecture activities and/or readings for you to complete. These activities prepare you for the in-class activities. Failure to complete them will put you behind in an already compressed course.\nTo prepare for the first class:\n\nInstall R and R Studio\n\ninstallation video tutorial\nDetailed instructions on installing R and R Studio are available on swirl.\n\nComplete step 1 and step 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSwirl is a great tool to learn R interactively that we will use in the course. Feel free to explore more.\n\n\n\nIn the first class, we will begin to get familiar with R. Complete the Pre-reading material about R. Pre-reading materials for each class are located under Resources. Sometimes, pre-reading materials are direct links to external resources for you to read in advance of the lecture."

Read the instructions. Practice running the chunks individually using the “play” button and the keyboard short cut.\nChange the settings of the Quarto document to display the output “inline” or in the “console”.\nRender the document and view the HTML output.

    "text": "The FASTQ file format is the defacto format for unmapped sequence reads generated from next-generation sequencing technologies.\nThe image belows shows the structure for one read entry in a FASTQ file, its important to note these files will have a million reads meaning millions of entries repeating this same structure:\n\n\n\n\n\nEach entry can be broken down to four lines. Line 1 will always start with the @ symbol followed by sequence identifiers like instrument ID, run number, flow cell ID, etc. Line 2 will be the sequence itself. Line 3 will always start with the + symbol and on occasion be followed by the same information on line 1. It acts as a seperator between lines 2 and 4. Line 4 will contain the quality score for each nucleotide in the sequnce of Line 2, encoded in ASCII characters.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile reads are getting sequenced in a sequencer, quality predictor values are being created for each base call determined by the light signal emitted of each base, sign-to-noise ratio, and other factors determined by the machine. These Values are then used to calculate a Phred (Q) Score that takes into account the probability of a base call being incorrect and gives a prediction on probability of an error occuring in the base calling by the machine. The higher the Q-Score the less likely a base call is incorrect. To simplify this information to add to FASTQ files, an ASCII character is used and found by adding 33 to the Q-Score. The summed number and the ASCII chart is then used to find a character to allocate to the quality of each base.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSequencing Accuracy Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIlluminia Measuring Sequencing Accuracy\nIlluminia Understanding Illumina Quality Scores"
